I love C, Go and Lua. I've written several Lua bindings over the last few years, including a plugin system for an enbedded platform.

I used openssl in the past to verify PE/COFF binaries through Authenticode. Recently, I'm trying to contribute to mbedtls.

When I need to automate something, Python and shell script make me happy.

I don't like javascript, but I can tolerate Typescript. In the javascript world, I respect the node.js API.

I worked on UEFI drivers for a couple of years at HP.

Ten years ago, I wrote a dozen device drivers for the ancient 2.4 kernel.
